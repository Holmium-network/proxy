28/09/2019 - going off-script
• added a new building
• added fortune cookies (a new heavenly upgrade)
• more upgrades, achievements etc
• updated the Russian bread cookies icon to better reflect their cyrillic origins
• stealth update : the sugar lump refill timeout (not sugar lump growth) now no longer ticks down while the game is closed (this fixes an exploit)
• also released the official Android version of Cookie Clicker, playable here (iOS version will come later)
01/04/2019 - 2.019 (the "this year" update)
• game has been renamed to "Cookie Clicker" to avoid confusion
• can now click the big cookie to generate cookies for free
• removed fall damage
• removed all references to computer-animated movie Hoodwinked! (2005)

• added over 20 new cookies, all previously suggested by our supporters on Patreon
• added 2 heavenly upgrades
• the Golden goose egg now counts as a golden cookie upgrade for Residual luck purposes
• golden sugar lumps now either double your cookies, or give you 24 hours of your CpS, whichever is lowest (previously was doubling cookies with no cap)
• the amount of heralds is now saved with your game, and is used to compute offline CpS the next time the game is loaded; previously, on page load, the offline calculation assumed heralds to be 0
• added a system to counteract the game freezing up (and not baking cookies) after being inactive for a long while on slower computers; instead, this will now trigger sleep mode, during which you still produce cookies as if the game was closed; to enable this feature, use the "Sleep mode timeout" option in the settings

• made tooltips for building CpS boosts from synergies hopefully clearer

• fixed a bug with golden cookies/reindeer not disappearing properly in some circumstances
• the Dragon\'s Curve aura should now properly make sugar lumps twice as weird
• the ctrl key should less often register incorrectly as pressed
• added a new ad slot in the top-right, as while our playerbase is strong and supportive as ever, our ad revenue sometimes fluctuates badly; we may remove the ad again should our income stabilize
• made a few adjustments to make the game somewhat playable in mobile browsers; it\'s not perfect and can get buggy, but it\'s functional! (you may need to zoom out or scroll around to view the game properly)
• speaking of which, we also got some good progress on the mobile app version (built from scratch for mobile), so stay tuned!
25/10/2018 - feedback loop

08/02/2016 - legacy

• sounds have been added (can be disabled in the options)

Miss the old version? Your old save was automatically exported here!
05/02/2016 - legacy beta, more fixes

03/02/2016 - legacy beta, part III

-new option for a less grating cookie sound (enabled by default)

• Changes
-early game should be a bit faster and very late game was kindly asked to tone it down a tad
-dragonflight should be somewhat less ridiculously overpowered
-please let me know if the rebalancing was too heavy or not heavy enough
-santa and easter upgrades now depend on Santa level and amount of eggs owned, respectively, instead of costing several minutes worth of CpS
-cookie upgrades now stack multiplicatively rather than additively
-golden switch now gives +50% CpS, and residual luck is +10% CpS per golden cookie upgrade (up from +25% and +1%, respectively)
-lucky cookies and cookie chain payouts have been modified a bit, possibly for the better, who knows!
-wrinklers had previously been reduced to a maximum of 8 (10 with a heavenly upgrade), but are now back to 10 (12 with the upgrade)
-an ascension now only counts for achievement purposes if you earned at least 1 prestige level from it
-the emblematic Cookie Clicker font (Kavoon) was bugged in Firefox, and has been replaced with a new font (Merriweather)
-the mysterious wrinkly creature is now even rarer, but has a shadow achievement tied to it
• Fixes
-prestige now grants +1% CpS per level as intended, instead of +100%

-the ascend screen should be less CPU-hungry
20/12/2015 - legacy beta, part II

• the Grandmapocalypse now spawns wrinklers, hideous elderly creatures that damage your CpS when they reach your big cookie. Thankfully, you can click on them to make them explode (you\'ll even gain back the cookies they\'ve swallowed - with interest!).
• wrath cookie now 27% spookier
• some other stuff
• you should totally go check out Candy Box 2, the sequel to the game that inspired Cookie Clicker
15/10/2013 - it\'s a secret
• added a new heavenly upgrade that gives you 5% of your heavenly chips power for 11 cookies (if you purchased the Heavenly key, you might need to buy it again, sorry)
• golden cookie chains should now work properly
15/10/2013 - player-friendly
• heavenly upgrades are now way, way cheaper
• tier 5 building upgrades are 5 times cheaper
• cursors now just plain disappear with Fancy Graphics off, I might add a proper option to toggle only the cursors later
• warning : the Cookie Monster add-on seems to be buggy with this update, you might want to wait until its programmer updates it
15/10/2013 - a couple fixes
• golden cookies should no longer spawn embarrassingly often
• cursors now stop moving if Fancy Graphics is turned off
14/10/2013 - going for the gold
• golden cookie chains work a bit differently
• golden cookie spawns are more random
• CpS achievements are no longer affected by golden cookie frenzies
• revised cookie-baking achievement requirements
• heavenly chips now require upgrades to function at full capacity
• added 4 more cookie upgrades, unlocked after reaching certain amounts of Heavenly Chips
• speed baking achievements now require you to have no heavenly upgrades; as such, they have been reset for everyone (along with the Hardcore achievement) to better match their initially intended difficulty
• made good progress on the mobile port
01/10/2013 - smoothing it out
• some visual effects have been completely rewritten and should now run more smoothly (and be less CPU-intensive)
• new upgrade tier
• new milk tier
• cookie chains have different capping mechanics
• antimatter condensers are back to their previous price
• heavenly chips now give +2% CpS again (they will be extensively reworked in the future)
• farms have been buffed a bit (to popular demand)
• dungeons still need a bit more work and will be released soon - we want them to be just right! (you can test an unfinished version in the beta)
28/09/2013 - dungeon beta
• from now on, big updates will come through a beta stage first (you can try it here)
• first dungeons! (you need 50 factories to unlock them!)
• cookie chains can be longer
• antimatter condensers are a bit more expensive
• heavenly chips now only give +1% cps each (to account for all the cookies made from condensers)
• added flavor text on all upgrades
15/09/2013 - anticookies
• ran out of regular matter to make your cookies? Try our new antimatter condensers!
• renamed Hard-reset to "Wipe save" to avoid confusion
• reset achievements are now regular achievements and require cookies baked all time, not cookies in bank
• heavenly chips have been nerfed a bit (and are now awarded following a geometric progression : 1 trillion for the first, 2 for the second, etc); the prestige system will be extensively reworked in a future update (after dungeons)
• golden cookie clicks are no longer reset by soft-resets
• you can now see how long you\'ve been playing in the stats
08/09/2013 - everlasting cookies
• added a prestige system - resetting gives you permanent CpS boosts (the more cookies made before resetting, the bigger the boost!)
• save format has been slightly modified to take less space
• Leprechaun has been bumped to 777 golden cookies clicked and is now shadow; Fortune is the new 77 golden cookies achievement
• clicking frenzy is now x777
04/09/2013 - smarter cookie
• golden cookies only have 20% chance of giving the same outcome twice in a row now
• added a golden cookie upgrade
• added an upgrade that makes pledges last twice as long (requires having pledged 10 times)
• Quintillion fingers is now twice as efficient
• Uncanny clicker was really too unpredictable; it is now a regular achievement and no longer requires a world record, just *pretty fast* clicking
02/09/2013 - a better way out
• Elder Covenant is even cheaper, and revoking it is cheaper still (also added a new achievement for getting it)
• each grandma upgrade now requires 15 of the matching building
• the dreaded bottom cursor has been fixed with a new cursor display style
• added an option for faster, cheaper graphics
• base64 encoding has been redone; this might make saving possible again on some older browsers
• shadow achievements now have their own section
• raspberry juice is now named raspberry milk, despite raspberry juice being delicious and going unquestionably well with cookies
• HOTFIX : cursors now click; fancy graphics button renamed; cookies amount now more visible against cursors
01/09/2013 - sorting things out
• upgrades and achievements are properly sorted in the stats screen
• made Elder Covenant much cheaper and less harmful
• importing from the first version has been disabled, as promised
• "One mind" now actually asks you to confirm the upgrade
31/08/2013 - hotfixes
• added a way to permanently stop the grandmapocalypse
• Elder Pledge price is now capped
• One Mind and other grandma research upgrades are now a little more powerful, if not 100% accurate
• "golden" cookie now appears again during grandmapocalypse; Elder Pledge-related achievements are now unlockable
31/08/2013 - too many grandmas
• the grandmapocalypse is back, along with more grandma types
• added some upgrades that boost your clicking power and make it scale with your cps
• clicking achievements made harder; Neverclick is now a shadow achievement; Uncanny clicker should now truly be a world record
28/08/2013 - over-achiever
• added a few more achievements
• reworked the "Bake X cookies" achievements so they take longer to achieve
27/08/2013 - a bad idea
• due to popular demand, retired 5 achievements (the "reset your game" and "cheat" ones); they can still be unlocked, but do not count toward your total anymore. Don\'t worry, there will be many more achievements soon!
• made some achievements hidden for added mystery
27/08/2013 - a sense of achievement
• added achievements (and milk)

24/08/2013 - hotfixes

08/08/2013 - game launch

• ah well

Update
Hey there! Cookie Clicker just received a pretty substantial update, and you might notice that some things have been moved around. Don\'t panic!
Your building numbers may look strange, making it seem like you own buildings you\'ve never bought; this is because we\'ve added 3 new buildings after factories (and swapped mines and factories), offsetting everything after them. Likewise, some building-related upgrades and achievements may look a tad shuffled around. This is all perfectly normal!
We\'ve also rebalanced Heavenly Chips amounts and behavior. Your amount of chips might be lower or higher than before.
You can now ascend through the Legacy button at the top!

• Sugar lumps can be harvested when mature, though if left alone beyond that point they will start ripening (increasing the chance of harvesting them) and will eventually fall and be auto-harvested after some time.
• Sugar lumps are delicious and may be used as currency for all sorts of things.
• Once a sugar lump is harvested, another one will start growing in its place.
